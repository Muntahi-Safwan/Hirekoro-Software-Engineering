# Hirekoro – Freelancing Management System

Hirekoro is a freelancing management system that brings hiring, project management, communication, and payment handling into a single, structured platform.

---

## Project Overview

Hirekoro is designed to simplify collaboration between clients and freelancers. Instead of using multiple tools for hiring, messaging, tracking tasks, and managing payments, the platform provides all essential functions in one place.

The system supports three primary roles:

* Client – Creates projects and hires freelancers
* Freelancer – Works on projects and manages tasks
* Admin – Manages users, projects, payments, and system activity

---

## Project Objectives

* Simplify freelancer hiring and project initiation
* Provide structured project and task management
* Enable direct client–freelancer communication
* Ensure secure payment and invoice handling
* Give administrators full control over platform activities

---

## Target Users

### Clients

* Find suitable freelancers quickly
* Manage projects, tasks, and payments
* Communicate directly with freelancers

### Freelancers

* Present skills and experience clearly
* Manage multiple projects and tasks
* Track payments and build reputation through reviews

### Administrators

* Manage users, projects, tasks, and payments
* Monitor logs and system activity
* Control reviews and maintain platform quality

---

## Core Features

* Multi-role authentication (Client, Freelancer, Admin)
* Profile management
* Freelancer search and hiring
* Project creation and tracking
* Task management
* Messaging system
* Payment and invoice management
* Review and rating system
* Admin dashboard and system logs

## Process Model: Scrum

Scrum was used as the development process model because the project includes many features and evolving requirements. Scrum allows development in short cycles called Sprints, enabling early testing, regular feedback, and continuous improvement.

### Why Scrum Was Chosen

* Supports changing requirements
* Divides work into manageable Sprints
* Enables early testing and quick fixes
* Encourages teamwork through regular discussion
* Fits well with academic timelines (2–4 week Sprints)

One team member has real freelancing experience and acted as the customer or Product Owner, helping to prioritize features based on real-world needs.

---

## Why Other Models Were Not Chosen

* FDD – Better for large systems with stable features; our requirements changed frequently
* XP – Requires strict practices like pair programming and test-driven development, which were difficult to follow consistently as students
* DSDM – Needs continuous formal user involvement, which is not always possible in an academic setting
* Traditional models (Waterfall, V-Model, Incremental) – Too rigid for projects with changing requirements

---

## Development Approach

* Development completed in 2–4 week Sprints
* Regular discussion for progress and problem solving
* Sprint Review for feedback
* Sprint Retrospective for improvement
* Continuous testing after each Sprint

---

## Testing Strategy

* Manual testing of all major modules
* Test cases designed for core features
* Bugs fixed in following Sprints
* Both functional and non-functional testing applied

---

## System Structure

* Frontend – User interface and interaction
* Backend – Business logic, authentication, APIs
* Database – Storage for users, projects, tasks, payments, and reviews

---

## Future Enhancements

* Intelligent freelancer recommendation system
* Video interview feature
* Advanced analytics dashboard
* Mobile application version
